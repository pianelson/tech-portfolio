### Luna is an AI-powered chatbot designed with Twilio to serve as a mental health check-in for Twitter users whose recent tweets have been deemed to be indicative negative emotions.

Our initial idea was filtering through twitter to find derogatory words and suggest alternative, kinder words, following along with Twitter's theme #HealthyConversations. We passed up this idea because we'd only be able to see those derogatory words after they've already been posted. Instead we wanted to do something that would benefit social media users proactively. We modified the initial idea a bit, and instead of derogatory words, we decided to look for negative words, or words indicating negative mood. We geared our project towards those struggling with mental llness as it has become more prevalent now than ever, and the pandemic limits people's ability to get help. We also got inspiration from Eliza, a chatbot who allows open ended venting about your day.

Over the course of 2-3 days, I collaborated on a user-centered design project with a UMD graduate student, Shaan Chopra, a fellow Computer Science undegraduate student Ambika Sikri and a former tech professional who now suffers from dementia in creating a technology solution that was designed to help people who have dementia remember, or rather, not have to remember which items they're running low on. Our goal was to develop an application through which a smart device like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home could receive verbal feedback from the person with dementia, like "Alexa, add deodorant to my shopping list." Alexa would then add the user's preferred deodorant to a shopping list. The user would then be able to choose to purchase their items from their desired retailers through the app or get access to their curated shopping so they can carry it with them to the store. THe app will also keep track of their purchase history so the user can be reminded of the brand of an item that they use in case they forget, or reminded that this is about the time of month that they'd usually buy something so they can be reminded of items they might not have noticed ran out.
