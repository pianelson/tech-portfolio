# Introducing Pia Nelson

## Current Role
I'm graduating senior at the University of Central Florida and a Research Assistant at Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab in Orlando, Florida. I'm also the President of my school's Cognitive Sciences Club.
## Recognition

- 2020 Awesome Woman in Technology Award

### Aquarius Sun, Taurus Moon, Libra Rising
Spirituality has been a grounding force for me throughout my academic career. Meditation, astrology, tarot, manifestation and introspectation have become core components of my identity. They have provided me with unique opportunity to learn more about things that a lot of people dismiss and understand the perspective of people who do participate in these practices. It has also allowed me to learn more about myself and who I can become.

### Cognitive Sciences Club President
I started a club because I had an interest in understanding human behavior in a way that was not supported in the academic realm of my university.
### Social Activist
I've been to several protests in the past year and have been vocal about issues concerning women's  rights, black rights, LGBTQ rights and Native American rights.
### Anime 
At any given time, I'm watching three animes concurrently. Right now, I'm rewatching Naruto and Inuyasha, while watching JoJo for the first time.
### Naturalista
I started working on a natural hair application with a friend with the goal of creating something that could help people with curlier hair types learn how to deal with their hair.

### Important to me
1. Help eradicate homelessness, racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism and all forms of bigotry directly resultant of colonialism and the patriarchy without making white people feel as though they shouldn’t be a part of the conversation since they’re the ones that would need to actually make changes for this to be efficient
2. Advocate for mental health awareness and destigmatize the idea that people with mental illnesses should just be locked up in a psychiatric hospital everytime they do something that isn’t neurotypical.
3. Advocate for the children in detention centers and in orphanages who are being mistreated and taken advantage of because they are in positions of weakness. Provide resources that actually help reinstate these children into society as functioning, healthy members of society without adding to the trauma of not having their parents in their lives.
4. Provide mental health benefits for everyone.Therapy, introspection and spiritualism are the answer to reducing suicide rates. People don’t know their options and when they feel alone, it’s easier to be overwhelmed with things that don’t have to break the camel’s back.
5. Representation for minorities and their diverse interests. Providing well-researched answers to their niche problems. Representation down to even the photos on google when they google “woman”.
6. Creators who are trying to use their skills to pull themselves out of poverty stricken areas
