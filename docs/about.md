# Social Activist
I've been to several protests in the past year and have been vocal about issues concerning women's  rights, black rights, LGBTQ rights and Native American rights.
# Anime 
At any given time, I'm watching three animes concurrently. Right now, I'm rewatching Naruto and Inuyasha, while watching JoJo for the first time.
# Naturalista
I started working on a natural hair application with a friend with the goal of creating something that could help people with curlier hair types learn how to deal with their hair.
